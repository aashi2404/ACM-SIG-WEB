            <p style="color:red;font-size:20px; "> In conclusion, Netflix has been extreamly successful in maturing and developing to adapt to the changing needs of customers over time. While their original DVD-by-mail business model effective against competitors such as Blockbuster, the rise
                of internet streaming 's popularity meant they had to adjust. The comparision to blockbuster is important, as they are company failed to adapt and didn'tforsee the impact the internet would have on the movie rental industry(Kellmurray,n.d.).
                Netflix was then able to get customer loyaltyby providing things Blockbuster didn 't, such as no late fees and only needing to go to the mailbox to get the DVD(Kellmurray,n.d.). When the polpularity of the online streaming grew, Netflix
                embraced the change and used it to their advantage to become the comapny they are today.
